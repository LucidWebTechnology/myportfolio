## Prepared as a part of my Front-End Developer Certificate program.

I did this homework for the completion of IBM Front End Developer Professional certificate course.

Most of the material was presented in the course as ready made objects like the recommendation box at the bottom. The aim was to introduce us on how JavaScript works on online forms.

I did some alternations in css in order to personalize it.

It is also the project I used to understand how GitHub pages works.
